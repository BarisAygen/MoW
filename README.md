My first Unity project, developed as a learning-oriented prototype to understand the fundamentals of Unity and object-oriented design.
2-player game with three modes: 1v1, 3v3, 5v5
Turn-based combat with damage calculation
Character draft system: players ban and pick from a pool of 60 unique characters
Objective: eliminate all enemy characters to win
Practiced object-oriented principles in Unity (base classes, parentâ€“child class hierarchy, interfaces)
Explored modular code design for reusability and scalability
Implemented core mechanics like character selection, damage handling, and team composition logic

(Project unfinished, created mainly for learning and experimentation.)
