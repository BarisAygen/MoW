I coded this game to gain more experience in Unity and basically have fun. It is played with 2 players.
There are 60 characters in the game. Each player bans and chooses a character in their turn. There are 3 different character categories and each character has different skills.
After both sides choose 5 characters, game starts. In each turn, player chooses one of their character and performs its skill.
Each character has health and their unique skills (damaging directly, becoming invisible, gaining health, etc.)
Whoever eleminates every character of enemy's team wins the game.
I found this game in highschool years and it was so much fun to play it on the paper. That is why I wanted to give it a try on Unity. It is not completed yet. Soon will be finished.
