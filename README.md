This project is my first unity project to understand the very basics of Unity. 
It is not finished and probably will not :)
It is played with 2 players. There are 3 different gamemodes currently. 1v1 3v3 and 5v5. This indicates how many characters a player can select.
Each player bans and selects different characters from 60 of them and try to make the best combination.
The aim is to destroy all characters of enemy team and win the game.
